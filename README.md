- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @scor05
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games and programming, aswell as to how they're made and the logic behind them. I also love having a challenge with programming because it helps me learn new ways to solve problems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Python, and will like to start with JavaScript next.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mainly through this site or my current e-mail address.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I twisted my foot once during a soccer match and basically didn't think much of the pain until two days after when I went to the hospital and found out it was broken.
